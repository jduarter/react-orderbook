### 1. Project bootstrapping.

I've added common development-assist packages like: `prettier` and `eslint` and their respective configuration files.

I was setting up the most optimal project directory structure for the project:

| **Directory** | **Description**             |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| scripts/      | Helper scripts              |
| src/          | Source files of the project |

Additionally, I've added some package.json scripts for ease of development and execution:

| **Command**     | **Description**                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| npm install     | Install needed dependencies.                 |
| npx pod-install | Install iOS pods.                            |
| npm test        | Runs the test suite.                         |
| npm clean       | Cleans the build and node_modules directory. |

## Possible improvements:

- Safe compilation of regexps used by json-2.js sanitizer (src/json-sanitizer.js) to prevent regexp-security issues.
- Test: malformed JSON.
- Test: unsafe JSONs.
- Test: the reading date will always have the time set to 00:00:00.000
