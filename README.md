### 1. Project bootstrapping.

I've added common development-assist packages like: `prettier` and `eslint` and their respective configuration files.

I was setting up the most optimal project directory structure for the project:

| **Directory** | **Description**             |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| scripts/      | Helper scripts              |
| src/          | Source files of the project |

Additionally, I've added some package.json scripts for ease of development and execution:

| **Command**     | **Description**                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| npm install                | Install needed dependencies.                 |
| npx pod-install            | Install iOS pods.                            |
| npm test                   | Runs the test suite.                         |
| npm run lint:check         | Runs the linter in check (no-fix) mode.      |
| npm run format:fix         | Runs the linter in format (fix) mode.        |
| npm run cache:clearfull    | Completely wipes the RN cache.               |
| npm run typescript.        | Performs static typing validation (TS).      |

| npm run sec:outdated.      | Scans outdated packages.                     |
